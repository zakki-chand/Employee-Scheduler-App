# Employee-Scheduler-App


The **EmployeeSchedulerApp** was developed using both Python and Java to manage employee scheduling for a company operating seven days a week. It allows employees to choose shifts based on preferences (morning, afternoon, or evening). The application ensures no employee works more than one shift per day and a maximum of five days per week. It also manages shift conflicts, ensuring at least two employees per shift, resolving conflicts by randomly assigning shifts when necessary. The app outputs the final schedule in a readable format, accommodating employee preferences while meeting the companyâ€™s shift requirements.
